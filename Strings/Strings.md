#  ASCII Codes
## Character Set
Support for characters in a computer system is by assigning a number to a character. The numbers are/have to be standard across all computers and are called **ASCII codes** where ASCII stands for **American Standard Code for Information Interchange** for English.
Unicodes are codes defined by the ISO standard and support the other languages.

| Code  | Letter |
| :---: | :----: |
|   A   |   65   |
|   B   |   66   |
|  ...  |   ..   |
|   Z   |   90   |
|       |        |
|   a   |   97   |
|   b   |   98   |
|  ...  |  ...   |
|   z   |  132   |
|       |        |
|   0   |   48   |
|   9   |   57   |

ASCII codes range from **0 to 127**, therefore 7 bits are sufficient to store an ASCII character.
However, unicodes take **2 bytes** (16 bits) as they are for all languages, not just English. ASCII is a subset of unicode. Unicodes are usually represented in hexadecimal format.
